#10.6:

Regression models with interactions: The folder Beauty contains data (use file beauty.csv) from Hamermesh and Parker (2005) on student evaluations of instructorsâ€™ beauty and teaching quality for several courses at the University of Texas. The teaching evaluations were conducted at the end of the semester, and the beauty judgments were made later, by six students who had not attended the classes and were not aware of the course evaluations.
(a) Run a regression using beauty (the variable beauty) to predict course evaluations (eval), adjusting for various other predictors. Graph the data and fitted model, and explain the meaning of each of the coefficients along with the residual standard deviation. Plot the residuals versus fitted values.

(b) Fit some other models, including beauty and also other predictors. Consider at least one model with interactions. For each model, explain the meaning of each of its estimated
coefficients.

## a: Coefficient and residual standard deviation Interpretation
1. Beauty: 0.141. For every unit increase in the beauty rating, the course evaluation is expected to increase by approximately 0.141, holding all other variables constant. This indicates a positive effect of perceived beauty on evaluations.
2. Age: -0.0027. There is a slight negative association between age and course evaluation, but the effect is small and not statistically significant.
3. Female: -0.207. Female instructors receive evaluations that are, on average, 0.207 points lower than male instructors, holding other factors constant. This result is statistically significant.
4, Minority: -0.044. Minority instructors receive evaluations that are 0.044 points lower than non-minority instructors, but this effect is not statistically significant.
5. Non-English: -0.313. Instructors who are non-native English speakers tend to receive evaluations that are 0.313 points lower than native English speakers, a statistically significant result.

Residual Standard Deviation: 0.532. This indicates the typical deviation of observed evaluations from the predicted values by the model.

## b: Interpretation of coefficients for other models including interactions
### Model 2: 
1. Beauty: 0.194. The effect of beauty on course evaluations for male instructors (reference group) is a positive increase of 0.194 per unit increase in beauty.
2. Female: -0.214. Female instructors receive evaluations that are 0.214 points lower than male instructors when beauty is held constant.
3. Female:Beauty : -0.111. This indicates that for female instructors, the effect of beauty is smaller. In particular, for every unit increase in beauty, female instructors receive an increase of 0.111 points less compared to male instructors. This interaction is marginally significant.
4. Other coefficients remain similar to the first model.

### Model 3: 
1. Beauty: -0.443. In this model, the direct effect of beauty is negative. However, its interactions with other variables need to be considered for interpretation.
2. female:Beauty: 0.0125. This suggests that the effect of beauty increases with age. Older instructors benefit more from beauty in their evaluations.
3. minority:Beauty: -0.139. The negative interaction indicates that for minority instructors, beauty has a smaller positive effect on evaluations.
4. Beauty:nonenglish: 0.286. Non-native English speakers benefit more from beauty in their evaluations.

Residual standard error: 0.524. This model has a slightly lower residual standard error, indicating a better fit than the previous two models.

Residuals and predictions: The folder Pyth contains outcome y and predictors x1, x2 for 40 data points, with a further 20 points with the predictors but no observed outcome. Save the file to your working directory, then read it into R using read.table().
(a) Use R to fit a linear regression model predicting y from x1, x2, using the first 40 data points in the file. Summarize the inferences and check the fit of your model.
(b) Display the estimated model graphically as in Figure 11.2.
(c) Make a residual plot for this model. Do the assumptions appear to be met?
(d) Make predictions for the remaining 20 data points in the file. How confident do you feel about these predictions?

#12.6
12.6 Logarithmic transformations: The folder Pollution contains mortality rates and various
environmental factors from 60 U.S. metropolitan areas (see McDonald and Schwing, 1973). For
this exercise we shall model mortality rate given nitric oxides, sulfur dioxide, and hydrocarbons
as inputs. This model is an extreme oversimplification, as it combines all sources of mortality
and does not adjust for crucial factors such as age and smoking. We use it to illustrate log
transformations in regression.
(a) Create a scatterplot of mortality rate versus level of nitric oxides. Do you think linear regression will fit these data well? Fit the regression and evaluate a residual plot from the regression.
(b) Find an appropriate transformation that will result in data more appropriate for linear regression. Fit a regression to the transformed data and evaluate the new residual plot.
(c) Interpret the slope coefficient from the model you chose in (b)
(d) Now fit a model predicting mortality rate using levels of nitric oxides, sulfur dioxide, and hydrocarbons as inputs. Use appropriate transformations when helpful. Plot the fitted regression model and interpret the coefficients.
(e) Cross validate: fit the model you chose above to the first half of the data and then predict for the second half. You used all the data to construct the model in (d), so this is not really cross validation, but it gives a sense of how the steps of cross validation can be implemented.

cat("- **Model 2** introduces scaled normal priors based on the number of predictors, aiming to control overfitting.\n")
cat("- **Model 3** employs a regularized horseshoe prior, effectively shrinking less relevant coefficients towards zero and highlighting the most important predictors.\n")
