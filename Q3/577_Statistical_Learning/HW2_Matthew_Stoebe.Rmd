# Problem 1

\hstart

\[p(x) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}}\]

\begin{align*}
\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)} &= \frac{\frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}}}
{1-\frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}}} \\[1em]
&= \frac{\frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}}}
{\frac{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}} - \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}}} \\[1em]
&= \frac{\frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}}}{\frac{1}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}}} \\[1em]
&= e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1x}
\end{align*}

\hstop

# Problem 2

(a)

\hstart

\begin{align*}
odds = .37 = \frac{p}{1-p} \\[1em]
.37*(1-p) = .37-.37p = p \\[1em]
.37 = 1p + .37p = 1.37p \\[1em]
p = \frac{.37}{1.37} = .27
\end{align*}

\hstop

(b)

\hstart

\begin{align*}
odds =  \frac{p}{1-p} = \frac{.16}{1-.16}\\[1em]
odds = \frac{.16}{.84} = .19
\end{align*}

\hstop


# Problem 3

(a)

\hstart

\begin{align*}
\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1(30) + \hat{\beta}_2(3.25) &= -5 + 0.1 \times 30 + 1 \times 3.25 \\
&= -5 + 3 + 3.25 \\
&= 1.25
\end{align*}

\[\hat{p} = \frac{e^{1.25}}{1 + e^{1.25}} = \frac{3.4903}{1 + 3.4903} \approx 0.78\]

\hstop

(b)

\hstart

\begin{align*}
\log\left(\frac{0.60}{1-0.60}\right) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1(x) + \hat{\beta}_2(3.25) \\[1em]
0.4054 &\approx -5 + 0.1h + 1(3.25) \\[1em]
h &\approx 21.6 \text{ hours}
\end{align*}

# Problem 4

(a)
```{r prob4a}
##R code for problem 4a
titanic = read.csv("titanic.csv")

glmOut <- glm(
  survived ~ factor(passenger_class) + gender + ns(age, 3) + ns(fare_paid, 3),
  data = titanic,
  family = binomial
)

summary(glmOut)

```

\hstart

The fitted beta for female is 2.6192. If we exponentiate this we get  an odds value of 13.92. This means that women had signifficantly higher odds of surviving 

\hstop

(b)
```{r prob4b}
#R code for problem 4b
new.df <- data.frame(
  passenger_class = 2,
  gender          = "woman",
  age            = 25,
  fare_paid      = 20
)

prob.survive <- predict(glmOut, newdata = new.df, type = "response")
prob.survive

```
\hstart

The Probability of surviving under these conditions is .812

\hstop


(c)

```{r prob4c}
#R code for problem 4c
 new.df <- data.frame(
  passenger_class = 3,
  gender          = "man",
  age            = 15,
  fare_paid      = 10
)

prob.survive <- predict(glmOut, newdata = new.df, type = "response")
prob.survive

```

\hstart

This Child has approximately a .12 probability of survival

\hstop

# Problem 5

(a)
```{r prob5a, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, out.width="100%"}
##R code for problem 5a
library(ISLR)
library(reshape2)  # For reshaping data

ggplot(Weekly, aes(x = Volume)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, fill="blue", color="black", alpha=0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Trading Volume") +
  xlab("Volume") +
  ylab("Frequency")

library(corrplot)
cor_matrix <- cor(Weekly[, c("Lag1", "Lag2", "Lag3", "Lag4", "Lag5", "Volume", "Today")])

corrplot(cor_matrix, 
         method = "color",
         type = "upper",  
         tl.col = "black",
         tl.srt = 45,
         addCoef.col = "black", 
         number.cex = 0.8)

```

\hstart

The Correlation between these features is is so low that I wouldnt even proceed to train a model in this case. 

\hstop

(b)
```{r prob5b}
#R code for problem 5b
glm.weekly <- glm(Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2 + Lag3 + Lag4 + Lag5 + Volume,
                  data = Weekly, family = binomial)
summary(glm.weekly)

```
\hstart

Only the Lag2 feature appears significant. this is not surprising as the correlation was so low above. This feature set is quite weak. 

\hstop


(c)

```{r prob5c}
#R code for problem 5c
prob <- predict(glm.weekly, type="response")
pred <- ifelse(prob > 0.5, "Up", "Down")

table(Predicted=pred, Actual=Weekly$Direction)
mean(pred == Weekly$Direction)  # fraction of correct predictions

```
\hstart

This Model is terrible and overly optimistic. It predicts the marekt to go up almost 90% of thhe time when it only goes up around 60% of the time. 

The correct prediction rate is 56 percent which is terrible. This is almost as bad as always predicting the market to go up. 

Additionally, We are evaluating on the train set here which makes this performance even more terrible. 

\hstop

(d)

```{r prob5d}
#R code for problem 5d
train <- (Weekly$Year <= 2009)
Weekly.train <- Weekly[train, ]
Weekly.test  <- Weekly[!train, ]

glm.train <- glm(Direction ~ Lag2, data=Weekly.train, family=binomial)
prob.test <- predict(glm.train, Weekly.test, type="response")
pred.test <- ifelse(prob.test > 0.5, "Up", "Down")

table(Predicted=pred.test, Actual=Weekly.test$Direction)
mean(pred.test == Weekly.test$Direction)

```
\hstart

This model supposedly performs better but we are using a poor eval metric. Again this is overly optimistic predicting up in all but 3 cases. Recall may be 100% but our precision is terribly low.

\hstop


# Problem 6
```{r prob7}
#R code for problem 7

```


```{r prob7_finalmodel, echo = T, eval = F}

heart_train <- read.csv("heart_training.csv")
heart_test  <- read.csv("heart_test.csv")

glm.final <- glm(target ~ age + slope + thalach,
                 data = heart_train, family = binomial)
summary(glm.final)
prob.test <- predict(glm.final, heart_test, type = "response")
pred.test <- ifelse(prob.test > 0.5, 1, 0)

cat("Final Accuracy", mean(pred.test == heart_test$target))

```

\hstart

Test Data Accuracy is .8166. This is technically data leakage as we are doing feature and model selection on the test set.
