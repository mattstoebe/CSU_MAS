# Hand Washing 1 (Q1 - Q5)

An investigator is planning a hand-washing study.  They want to evaluate the effect of water temperature (60, 80, 100 or 120 F) on bacterial count on peopleâ€™s palms after hand-washing.  They plan to recruit a total of n = 32 subjects and will randomly assign each subject to wash their hands with a single water temperature.

## Q1

Identify the experimental units.

*****
Response 

*****

## Q2

Identify the treatment (or factor) and number of levels. 

*****
Response

*****

## Q3

Identify the response variable.

*****
Response

*****

## Q4

Suggest one approach that could be used to "reduce noise" when conducting this study.  This is a "common sense" question with many possible correct answers, not something you will find in a textbook.

*****
Response

*****

## Q5

Use R `sample()` to randomly assign 32 subjects to temperatures (60, 80, 100 or 120 F) requiring balance (equal number of subjects per temperature).  Show a summary table giving the number of subjects per treatment.

# Hand Washing 2 (Q6 - Q7)

We continue with the hand-washing study.  But now suppose that each subject will be asked to wash their hands 4 times (on 4 different days), such that each subject experiences all 4 water temperatures.  This is an example of a blocked or repeated measures design. 

## Q6

Name one benefit of this design as compared to the original design.

*****
Response

*****

## Q7

Suggest one way that randomization could be incorporated into this study design.
