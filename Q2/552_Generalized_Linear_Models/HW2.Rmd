# Diabetes 2 (Q1 - Q6)

A researcher is interested in estimating the proportion of US adults who have been diagnosed with diabetes ($\pi$).  Consider a study where n = 65 people are contacted and asked whether they have been diagnosed with diabetes.   Suppose this is based on a random sample of US adults.  From this sample, 7 people have been diagnosed with diabetes.

:::: {.taskbox data-latex=""}
## Q1 (2 pts)

Calculate $\hat\pi$.
::::

*****
Response

```{r}
#Q1
n <- 65
t <- 7

pihat <- t/n

print(pihat)
```

*****

:::: {.taskbox data-latex=""}
## Q2 (4 pts)

Discuss whether the large sample normal approximation is reasonable here.  Use the rule of thumb from the course notes.
::::

*****
Response

This should be sufficient. We generally want to see two things:

1. n*pihat > 5 TRUE
2. n*(1-pihat) > 5 True

In our case both 7 and 58 are greater than 5
*****

:::: {.taskbox data-latex=""}
## Q3 (2 pts)

Use `prop.test( , correct = TRUE)` to calculate an (approximate) 95% confidence interval for $\pi$.  The resulting interval is generated using using Wilsonâ€™s score method.  You can just show the R output for full credit.
::::

```{r}
#Q3

prop.test(x = 7, n = 65, correct = TRUE)

```


:::: {.taskbox data-latex=""}
## Q4 (4 pts)

Using the confidence interval from the previous question, interpret the interval in context.  Aim for an interpretation that could be used in a write-up: avoid abbreviations and statistical jargon. 
::::

*****
Response

Based on the confidence interval shown above, we have 95% confidence that between 4.8 and 21.5% of adults in the US have been diagnosed with diabetes.
*****

:::: {.taskbox data-latex=""}
## Q5 (4 pts)

Construct an (approximate) 95% Wald confidence interval for $\pi$. Do this "by hand" (using R as a calculator) and echo your R code.
::::

***** 
Response

```{r, echo = TRUE}
#Q5

z <- qnorm(0.975)

pihat <- 7/65

lower <- pihat - z*sqrt((pihat*(1-pihat))/n)
upper <- pihat + z*sqrt((pihat*(1-pihat))/n)

cat("Wald confidence interval is", lower, "-", upper, "\n")


```

*****

:::: {.taskbox data-latex=""}
## Q6 (2 pts)

Use `binom.test()` to calculate the exact 95% confidence interval for $\pi$.  You can just show the R output for full credit.
::::

```{r}
#Q6

binom.test(x = 7, n = 65)

# Bomb Hits (Q7 - Q8)

This data is taken from Ott&Longnecker and originally from Hand (1993).  During WWII, bomb hits were recorded in the n = 576 grids in a map of a region of South London.  If the bomb hits were purely random, a Poisson model would produce the number of hits per grid.

| # Bomb Hits | 0   | 1   | 2  | 3  | 4+ | 
|-------------|---  |---  |--- |--- |----|
| # Grids     | 229 | 211 | 93 | 35 | 8  |

:::: {.taskbox data-latex=""}
## Q7 (2 pts)

Calculate $\hat\mu$, the sample mean hits per grid.  

Notes: (1) To do this calculation find the total number of bomb hits and divide by the number of grids. (2) For the calculation, treat 4+ as 4.  (3) Some example R code has been provided to get you started.  But other approaches are allowed.
::::

*****
Response

```{r}
#Q7
Bombs <- data.frame(Y = seq(from = 0, to = 4), 
                    Obs = c(229, 211, 93, 35, 8))

total <- sum(Bombs$Y*Bombs$Obs)
n <- sum(Bombs$Obs)

mu <- total/n

print(mu)

```

******

:::: {.taskbox data-latex=""}
## Q8 (8 pts)

Use the Pearson chi-square GOF test to test whether the number of bomb hits per grid follows the Poisson distribution.  Calculate the test statistic, df, p-value and give a conclusion (in context) using $\alpha$ = 0.05.  

Notes: (1) Do this "by hand" (using R as a calculator) but you can double check the test statistic using `chisq.test()`. (2) When calculating Poisson probabilities, you will use your $\hat\mu$ value from the previous question.  (3) When calculating Poisson probabilities, the last value should represent P($Y \ge 4$).  This can be done "manually".  (4) When calculating df, we "lose" 1 df because estimated $\hat\mu$.

Response


```{r}
#Q8
O <- Bombs$Obs

muhat <- total / n

E0 <- dpois(0, lambda<- muhat) * n
E1 <- dpois(1, lambda<- muhat) * n
E2 <- dpois(2, lambda<- muhat) * n
E3 <- dpois(3, lambda<- muhat) * n
E4 <- dpois(4, lambda<- muhat) * n

E <- c(E0, E1, E2, E3, E4)

Chisq <- sum((O-E)^2/E)
Chisq

df <- length(O) - 2
p <- 1 - pchisq(Chisq, df)
p

if (p < 0.05) {
  cat("Reject the null hypothesis as our P value is: ", p, ".\n There is evidence that the bomb hits do not follow a Poisson distribution.\n")
} else {
  cat("Fail to reject the null hypothesis as our P value is: ", p, ".\n There is no evidence against the bomb hits following a Poisson distribution.\n")
}

# Auto Accidents (Q9 - Q14)

CDA problem 2.4 concerns fatality results for drivers and passengers in auto accidents in Florida in 2008, according to whether the person was wearing a seat belt.

## Auto Accidents continued (Q11 - Q13)

Use injury as the response variable (with fatal injury being the "event of interest") and compare those not wearing seatbelts vs those wearing seatbelts.

:::: {.taskbox data-latex=""}
## Q11 (6 pts)

Provide an estimate of the **difference in proportions** and the corresponding (Wald) 95\% confidence interval.  Use the interval to make a conclusion about association between seat belt use and injury.  Be sure to mention the direction of association. (By direction of association, I just mean which group has the higher probability (risk) of fatal injury.)

*****

:::: {.taskbox data-latex=""}
## Q14 (2 pts)

Considering the results of the previous two questions, why are the relative risk and odds ratio approximated equal?
::::

*****
Response

The relative risk and odds ratio are approximately equal because fatal injury is rare in both groups. When the outcome is rare, the odds and the probabilities of the event are similar, making the odds ratio a close approximation of the relative risk.
